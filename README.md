# Python Crash Course - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to exercises and projects from **Python Crash Course** by Eric Matthes. It includes both chapter-by-chapter practice code and multi-chapter projects.

Chapter exercises are in the [basics/](./basics/) folder, organized into a separate folder for each chapter. Larger projects, like Alien Invasion, can be found in the [projects/](./projects/) folder.
